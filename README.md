# ApiForSanta
 <b>There are 3 projects in the solution:</b><br/>
 <br/>1. DBContextMigrations - for the entity framework update database operations.
 <br/>2. RequestsForSanta - The main project which includes the controllers and models.
 <br/>3. TestRequestsForSanta - unit testing project.
 The controllers are divided for 2 endpoints: one is for the children requests and one is for Santa only.
 <br/><br/>
 The testing project use the controllers for checking.
 I tried to use HttpClient instead and check with JSON but it didn't work so I gave up and wrote the testing method with the controllers.
 
 Have fun!<br/>
