# ApiForSanta
 The Santa`s mail is overloaded with letters from children. So, one day he decides to move his old school post office to the cloud. Santa asks you to help him build API for a new app. The app should be able to receive children requests for gifts, store them and show the final list. Santa wants to satisfy all the requests, but he has a limited budget for this year, therefore you should check that final gift list will be affordable.
